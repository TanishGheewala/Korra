Description:
    Wraps the compiled file_stats C tool as a LangGraph-compatible tool, so
    an agent can ask for the line, word, character, and byte counts of a text
    file and receive them as structured data. The C program does the analysis
    and prints one JSON object; on success this module runs it, parses that
    object, and returns it unchanged. On failure it returns a dictionary it
    builds itself, so a caller always receives a dictionary. It exists so
    Korra can reuse the Project 07 tool without reimplementing the analysis
    in Python, and the scope of the callable tool stops at process invocation
    and result parsing: it performs no counting of its own and formats nothing
    for display. The standalone block at the end does format output, under the
    LG-01 exemption below.

    The executable is located beside this file. Windows builds produce
    file_stats.exe and other platforms produce file_stats, and both names are
    tried so the same wrapper works in Windows, Linux, and Docker.

    Exemption: LG-01 is claimed under the Console Application exemption for
    the standalone block only. When this file is run directly its printed
    output is the user interface a student reads. Diagnostics use the logger.

Usage Instructions:
    1. Build the tool from the project folder, which compiles main.c,
       file_stats.c, and json_output.c and links them:
           make
       On Windows the executable is file_stats.exe; elsewhere file_stats.
    2. Run from a terminal for testing, from this tools folder:
           python file_stats_tool.py test.txt
       The exit status is 0 when the analysis succeeds and 1 when it fails.
    3. Use with LangGraph. Inside the korra project the tools folder is a
       sub-package of react_agent, so graph.py imports it as:
           from react_agent.tools.file_stats_tool import analyze_file_statistics
           llm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools([analyze_file_statistics])

def analyze_file_statistics(filename: str) -> dict:

    Report the line, word, character, and byte counts of a text file.

    Runs the compiled C tool on the named file and returns the JSON object it
    prints. Characters and bytes are both counts of bytes read, so for any
    input they hold the same value. A relative filename is resolved against
    the current working directory of this process, which is not necessarily
    the folder holding the tool.

    Args:
        filename: Path of the text file to analyze, relative or absolute

    Returns:
        dict: On success, the analysis as printed by the C tool:
